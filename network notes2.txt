cross overs between network types on same tile cause not rendering somehow
- Previous x,y,z could be used as a grid position instead
- Or other size 

tip
networkfile 2 store undergound and road stuff

Bug
-zooming cuts off the top of the map
- offset and padding anchor from the top right should be equal on all sides
- simple auto expand on layers checkbox
- Cleanup properties window in mainform code
- retain zoomed in when changing params
- TODOs
- add more comments
- Save button auto focus
- success textbox is empty
- output path is empty
- put restore defaults somewhere
- get expand arrows to show up on side and bottom
- Load without lot file present
- Entering 0 manually in segment offset (and probably in others) doesn't work
- outputh path has nothing in it

need:
place to save properties on main form?
layers window could be bigger 
save button could be clearer
control s control o

future:
- Retain position and zoom when modifying properties
- Add shadows at some point
- smooth squares that would be nice
- probably should hunt down those preview memory leaks
