type 0x03 is a road (then 0x0)

Notes:


Wins/knowns:
- Each item in network file is a single network tile
- Orientation connections (NorthConnection, SouthConnection... etc) match flow of road, can be used to create offset when rendering
- Orientation connection shows if network tile connects to neighbouring city
- 2nd set of size coordinates can be converted to grid position (divide by 16) of tile
- index files might be able to be parsed directly (won't have to parse index)

unknowns
- network type for street and road might have swapped, check if other types swap
- test all types
- why some stuff weird
- does some stuff appear in network file but not appear in city
