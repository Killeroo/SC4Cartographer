[zoom: 1 hour max
Cleanup zoom functions, check bitmap size (in opposite direction), get slider values to look nicer]

Bugs:
- Error while loading proper_terrain_for_non_maped.sc4cart
- Zones are cut off at the top/edge of the map
- Entering 0 manually in segment offset (and probably in others) doesn't work
