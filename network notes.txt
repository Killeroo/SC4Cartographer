Tasks:
- Render network file 1 and 2 tiles, add colour options to color menu, export to file (add work around to use first coordinates in case of an overflow) [road, rails, mono, subway]

Bugs:
- High terrains rendering as water
- Error while loading proper_terrain_for_non_maped.sc4cart
- Unchecking all terrain layers causes crash
- GetPixelinfo crashes when no map is loaded
- Zones are cut off at the top/edge of the map
- jpeg button doesn't work
- output path is empty
- success textbox is empty
- Entering 0 manually in segment offset (and probably in others) doesn't work
- text overflow in success form

Enhancements:
- Add option to toggle mapping terrain colors (off by default)
- Load without lot file present
- retain zoomed in when changing params
- TODOs
- Disable scroll wheel over numeric values
- autosave and load current parameters
- zone offset and padding anchor from the top right should be equal on all sides
- put restore defaults somewhere
- place to save properties on main form
- disallow special characters in alias textbox
- Make sure elements in different tabs are at the same level
- get expand arrows to show up on side and bottom
- need min window width and height
- Cleanup properties window code in mainform code
- simple auto expand on layers checkbox
- control s control o
- Save button auto focus
- add more comments
- Switch to using other terrain colour values for more accurate colours (from file)
- save button could be clearer

Testing:
- How city with NAM reacts
- no internet update check

- Small differences in network subfiles 2 and 1 on the wiki
- Post about findings on tunnel, bridge and highway network subfile as well as bad info for network index file
- Post showing SC4Parser

Tickets:
- Retain position and zoom when modifying properties
- Add shadows to terrain
- Smooth squares option
- probably should hunt down those preview memory leaks
